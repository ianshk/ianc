            I'm Ian, a Front-end web developer based in Hong Kong
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm a front-end React developer with a passion for simplifying complex problems and staying up to
            date with the latest web technologies. My focus is on creating responsive, efficient, and dynamic
            websites and applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in using React, and React frameworks like
            <a href="https://nextjs.org/"> Next.js</a> and
            <a href="https://remix.run/"> Remix</a>. I also love working with the
            <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/"> Tailwind CSS</a> library, These tools enable me to build
            powerful websites that provide a seamless user experience. I also have a strong sense of design
            and can create visually appealing interfaces that not only look great but also function
            flawlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I possess the necessary skills to transform Figma designs into React components that accurately
            reflect the original design. I prioritize meticulous attention to detail and strive to provide a
            visually cohesive end product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years I have honed my skills in both front-end javascript frameworks and back-end
            frameworks, allowing me to develop robust and seamlessly integrated web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm always looking for new ways to grow and learn. If you have any work opportunities that you
            think might be a good fit for me, please don't hesitate to reach out.
