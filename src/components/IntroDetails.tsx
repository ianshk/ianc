            I'm Ian, a Front-end web developer based in Hong Kong
          </h1>
          <p>
            I'm a front-end React developer with a passion for simplifying
            complex problems and staying up to date with the latest web
            technologies. My focus is on creating responsive, efficient, and
            dynamic websites that meet your specific needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in using Tailwind CSS, React, and React frameworks like
            Next.js and Remix. These tools enable me to build powerful websites
            that provide a seamless user experience. I also have a strong sense
            of design and can create visually appealing interfaces that not only
            look great but also function flawlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I possess the necessary skills to transform Figma designs into React
            components that accurately reflect the original design. I prioritize
            meticulous attention to detail and strive to provide a visually
            cohesive end product.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years I have honed my skills in both front-end javascript
            frameworks and back-end frameworks, allowing me to develop robust
            and seamlessly integrated web applications.
